## 1. Introduction
This project is aiming to explore and analyze the experiences of women in the workforce, whether that be during interviews, in the workplace, participation, wage gaps, leave policies, or other factors. 


## 2. Problem Statement: Data Science Scope
This project is geared toward reaching both employees and employers of all genders, in order to raise awareness of deficits in certain areas and specify the areas in which females are underrepresented, discriminated, or have difficulty succeeding in. This will not only be a benefit to the current female workforce, but also for the incoming generation of female employees and employers to be able to understand their position in the workforce.
